 INHERITANCE defn::
 
 Inheritance is the process of inheriting the properties and behavior of an existing class into a new class. When we inherit the class, we can reuse the existing class’s methods 
 and fields into a new class. Inheritance can also be defined as the Is-A relationship, which is also known as the parent-child relationship.
 

 USE OF INHERITANCE ::

 ● The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability. We can reuse the code when we inherit the existing class’s methods and fields into a new class. 
 ● The runtime polymorphism (method overriding) can be achieved by inheritance only.

 

IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY OF INHERTANCE ::
 
 ● Sub Class:The class that inherits properties fromanother class is called Subclass or Derived Class.
 ● Super Class:The class whose properties are inheritedby subclass is called Base Class or Superclass.
