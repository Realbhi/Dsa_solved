PROTECTED : This access modifier is kind of similar to private because ,the memeber with protected access modifier can be accessed  only within the class but the check is 
it can also be accessed in the child class.

In the below code we can observe that , the mode of inheritance is protected.So the public member inherited will also become protected .As we cannot access the protected 
members outside the class so i have created print function.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Human
{
    public:

    string name;
    int age;
    int height;

};

class Male : protected Human
{
     
     public:

     int weight;

     void match_info(string name,int age,int height)
    {
      this->name=name;
      this->age=age;
      this->height=height;
    }

    void print()
    {
       cout<<this->name<<" "<<this->age<<" "<<this->height<<endl;

    }

};


int main()
{
   Male obj;
   obj.weight=54;
   obj.match_info("abhi",21,6);
   obj.print();
   
}
