MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE ::

When a class inherits from a derived class, and the derived class becomes the base class of the new class, it is called multilevel inheritance. In multilevel inheritance,
there is more than one level.

CODE::

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

// Parent class 
class Animal 
{ 
   public: void eat() 
   { 
       cout << "eating" << endl; 
   } 
}; 

// Child class 
class Dog: public Animal 
{ 
    public: void bark() 
    {
       cout << "barking" << endl; 
    } 
}; 

class BabyDog: public Dog 
{ 
    public: void weep() 
    { 
        cout << "weeping"; 
    } 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
   // Creating an object of the child class 
   BabyDog obj; 
   // calling methods 
   obj.eat();  
   obj.bark(); 
   obj.weep(); 
} 

Output: 
eating 
barking 
weeping
